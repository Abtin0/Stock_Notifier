# Stock News Alert

This Python script fetches stock data for a specific company (Tesla Inc. by default) and sends an SMS alert if there is a significant change in the stock price (greater than 5%). The alert includes a summary of the latest news articles about the company.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Twilio account for SMS notifications
- Alpha Vantage API key for stock data
- News API key for fetching news articles

## Setup

1. **Install required libraries**:
   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install requests twilio
   
2. **Environment variables**: 
    Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following environment variables with your credentials:

    ```env
    STOCKS_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key
    NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
    TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
    USER_PHONE_NUMBER=your_phone_number
    ```

3. **Run the script**: 
The script will fetch the daily stock data for the given stock symbol (TSLA by default) and check if the percentage change in the stock price exceeds 5%. If it does, the script will fetch the latest news articles and send an SMS with the stock change and news summary.

## Run 

1. To run the script, simply execute the following command:
    ```python
    main.py

## How it works

**Fetch stock data**:\
The script uses the Alpha Vantage API to get the daily stock prices for a given stock symbol (e.g., TSLA).

**Check for significant change**:\
It compares the opening price of the stock for the last two days. If the price change exceeds 5%, it proceeds to the next step.

**Fetch news articles**:\
The script uses the News API to fetch the latest news articles related to the company (e.g., Tesla Inc.).

**Send SMS**:\
If the stock change is significant, the script sends an SMS to the user with the percentage change and the latest news articles using the Twilio API.

**Example Message**:\
If the stock price change is greater than 5%, the message will look like this:
```
    TSLA: ðŸ”º 6%

## Error Handling
If the stock price change is less than 5%, no SMS will be sent, and the script will print a message indicating this.
In case of data issues or other errors (e.g., network issues), the script will print an error message.
